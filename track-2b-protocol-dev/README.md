# Track 2B: AI-Assisted Protocol Development

**Lead:** Rick Wierenga (rick@retro.bio)
**Goal:** Use AI coding tools to write and run protocols on the Hamilton STARlet and Cephla microscope

---

## Instruments

### Hamilton STARlet (liquid handler)
- **Interface:** PyRobot (Python library)
- **Channel:** 8-span (processes 8 wells simultaneously)
- **Use cases:** Serial dilutions, media preparation, hitpicking

### Cephla Squid Microscope
- **Objective:** 4X
- **Use cases:** Cell imaging, colony counting, morphology assessment

---

## What to Build

Programs that use these instruments to:
1. **Serial dilutions** — dilute media components across a plate
2. **Hitpicking** — identify and transfer wells with specific properties
3. **Imaging** — capture and analyze images of growing cultures

---

## Getting Started

Ask Rick or a Monomer team member for:
- PyRobot documentation
- Cephla API reference
- Instrument access and scheduling

Track leads will provide code templates and help with instrument connection on the day.
